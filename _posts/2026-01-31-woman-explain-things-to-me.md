I have just finished Jenny Odell’s Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock. I am standing at the window in my bedroom, filled with a sense of wonder. Her words are still humming in my mind as I search for a place within myself to hold the small golden treasures I have found in her book—insights that may, in time, bear fruit in my own life, from where I stand in the world.
I place the book on the small stack of books I am currently reading and notice that all the authors are women: Jenny Odell, Naomi Klein, Rebecca Solnit, and Arundhati Roy. My gaze drifts across the titles and comes to rest on Rebecca Solnit’s Men Explain Things to Me. With a touch of humor, I realize that for me, it is women who explain things to me.
Not “explaining” in the sense of making something plain or comprehensible to someone who does not understand it, nor in the condescending way Solnit describes in her essay—where the person doing the explaining often knows less about the subject than the person being addressed. Rather, these women explain things in the sense of offering reasons, causes, and ways of seeing. Reading their books expands the reader. When I finish one of them, I find that I can look at the world differently than I did when I began.
Although these writers address different subjects and each has a distinct literary voice, I see three things that unite them.
First, they share a critical perspective on our (capitalist) society. Their analyses dismantle and reassemble events and processes into new patterns, always attentive to questions of power and control—who holds power, and who does not.
Second, they are tireless explorers of culture and history. Deeply learned, they repeatedly show that alternative futures are possible.
Finally, they insist that we must not give up hope—that together, we can change our world for the better.
Some of these books were written several years ago, yet what I have discovered is that they are at least as relevant today as they were when they first appeared—for better and for worse.
